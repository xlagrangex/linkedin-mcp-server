# tests/test_send_message_confirmation_dom.py
"""Browser-DOM tests for the send_message post-send confirmation (issue #866).

The unit suite mocks ``page.evaluate``, so none of what decides "sent" ever
runs there: the JS focus, the keyboard typing into a contenteditable, the
Send click and the occurrence count taken across the resulting DOM. These
cases drive the production ``send_message`` path in headless chromium and
replace navigation and recipient discovery only, so every step the
confirmation depends on executes unchanged: recipient verification reads
this page's own identity and submission clicks this page's own button.
Skipped automatically when
chromium is not installed; run locally after
``uv run patchright install chromium --no-shell``.

Both fixtures place an identical earlier message in the thread, which is
what made "the text is somewhere on the page" worthless as evidence: the
composer holds the message before it is sent, and the earlier copy holds it
whether or not the send succeeds.
